## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/josephrexme/windener.git themes/windener

If you use [netlify](https://netlify.com), you should add that directory as a submodule:

    $ git submodule add -b master https://github.com/josephrexme/windener.git themes/windener

For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### Configuration

The [example config](https://github.com/josephrexme/windener/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) can be copied to the root of your hugo folder directory. Customize the configurations as you wish.

**Logo** and **Favicon** could be changed from the config file. You could also add username for **disqus**, **google analytics** code. Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/josephrexme/windener/issues).

#### Adding pages to the navigation
Create a markdown file in the content directory (e.g `about.md`) and add a `_index.md` and you can create as many static pages as you want that way but note that the theme doesn't visually organize the pages into a hamburger when you have too many.
